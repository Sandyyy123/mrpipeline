# mrpipeline
Complete pipeline for generating analysis for manuscript and poster
1. Generation of triangular graph
2. Generation of power graph
3. Search for proxy SNPs in the exposure dataset
4. Synchronization of exposure and outcome datasets
5. Generation of tables (causal estimates using multiple MR methods, measures of heterogeneity and power analysis)
6. Generation of heat maps
7. Generation of sensitivity analysis graphs
8. Idenification of overlapping loci across multiple exposures
9. Plotting of Venn graphs
10. Causal estimates after removal of overlapping loci
11. Import of expression data 
12. Calculation of tissue specific causal estimates
13. Import of Phenoscanner data
